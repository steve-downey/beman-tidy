`beman-tidy` is a tool aimed at Beman Project contributors to check (`--dry-run`)
and apply (`--fix-inplace`) the [Beman Standard](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/beman_standard.md)
to their repositories.

**Note `2025-06-07`:** The first iteration of the tool will not support `--fix-inplace` in order to
expedite adoption across the Beman Project.

## Installation

```shell
uv tool install beman-tidy
```

To update:

```shell
uv tool upgrade beman-tidy
```

Post-install sanity check:

```shell
beman-tidy --help
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- `uv` (Python package and project manager - [Installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))

## Compatibility

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

## Usage

- Display help:

```shell
$ beman-tidy --help
usage: beman-tidy [-h] [--fix-inplace | --no-fix-inplace] [--verbose | --no-verbose] [--require-all | --no-require-all] [--checks CHECKS] [--config CONFIG] repo_path

positional arguments:
  repo_path             path to the repository to check

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --fix-inplace, --no-fix-inplace
                        Try to automatically fix found issues
  --verbose, --no-verbose
                        print verbose output for each check
  --require-all, --no-require-all
                        all checks are required regardless of the check type (e.g., Recommendation becomes Requirement)
  --checks CHECKS       array of checks to run
  --config CONFIG       path to the configuration file (default: .beman-tidy.yaml in repo root)
```

- Run beman-tidy on the exemplar repository **(default: dry-run mode)**

```shell
# dry-run, require-all, non-verbose
$ beman-tidy --require-all /path/to/exemplar
Summary    Requirement:  18 checks passed, 1 checks failed, 5 checks skipped,  23 checks not implemented.

- Run beman-tidy on the exemplar repository (fix issues in-place):

```shell
beman-tidy --fix-inplace --verbose path/to/exemplar
```

## CI Usage (GitHub Actions)

This repository already includes a full workflow in `.github/workflows/beman-tidy.yml` covering linting,
tests, build/install, and running `beman-tidy` on `bemanproject/exemplar`.

## Configuration

`beman-tidy` attempts to read configuration for each source file from a `.beman-tidy.yaml` file located in the root of your repository. You can also specify a custom configuration file path using the `--config` option.

The following configuration options may be used in a `.beman-tidy.yaml` file:

- `ignored_paths` - A list of patterns for paths to be excluded from all checks.
  - Entries use [`.gitignore` pattern syntax](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format): wildcards (`*`, `?`, `[abc]`), `**` for spanning directories, a leading `/` to anchor a pattern to the repository root, a trailing `/` to match directories only, and a leading `!` to re-include a path.
  - To ignore a specific file, provide its full path relative to the repository root.
  - To ignore a directory, provide the path to that directory. This will ignore the directory itself and all files and subdirectories within it. A trailing slash (`/`) is optional.
  - A pattern without a `/` matches at any depth, so `detail` ignores every `detail` entry in the repository, while `/detail` only ignores the one in the root.

- Example:
  ```yaml
  ignored_paths:
    # Ignores a single file
    - include/beman/optional/detail/stl_interfaces/config.hpp

    # Ignores a directory and everything inside it
    - include/beman/optional/another_dir

    # Ignores every generated header, wherever it is
    - "**/generated/*.hpp"

    # Checks one file anyway, even though the pattern above covers it
    - "!include/beman/optional/generated/api.hpp"
  ```

- `use_gitignore` - Whether the `.gitignore` files of the repository are honored. Defaults to `true`.
  - Every `.gitignore` in the repository is applied, each relative to its own directory, exactly as git applies them. A `.gitignore` inside an ignored directory is not read.
  - `README.md` and `LICENSE` are mandatory and are checked even if a `.gitignore` matches them. A warning is printed when that happens.
  - As in git, a path below an ignored *directory* cannot be re-included: if a `.gitignore` has `generated/`, no `!generated/api.hpp` entry brings `api.hpp` back. The repository has to ignore `generated/*` instead.
  - Set it to `false` to check paths that the repository does not track:

  ```yaml
  use_gitignore: false
  ```

- Ignore sources are consulted in this order, and the first pattern that matches decides:
  1. `ignored_paths` from `.beman-tidy.yaml`
  2. the `.gitignore` files of the repository, deepest directory first
  3. beman-tidy's built-in ignores (`build/`, `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, IDE directories, ...)

- `disabled_rules` - A list of rule names (or patterns) to be completely skipped during checks.
  - To disable a specific rule, provide its exact name (e.g., `readme.title`).
  - To disable all rules in a category, use a glob pattern with `*` (e.g., `readme.*` to skip all readme checks).
  - To disable a specific rule across all categories, use `*.rule_name` (e.g., `*.title`).
  - Unknown patterns that don't match any known rule will produce a warning and be skipped.
  - Disabled rules appear as "disabled" in the summary and are excluded from coverage calculations.

- Example:
  ```yaml
  disabled_rules:
    # Disable a single rule
    - readme.title

    # Disable all readme checks
    - readme.*

    # Disable all rules named "title" across categories
    - "*.title"
  ```

## Fix-inplace Status

- The CLI exposes `--fix-inplace`, but auto-fix support is currently limited.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

- Why is a check reported as skipped?
  - Some checks are intentionally skippable/dummy implementations and emit a reason in verbose mode.
- Why do I see "not implemented" in the summary?
  - The check exists in the Beman Standard snapshot but does not yet have an implemented checker.
- How do I ignore files/directories?
  - Use `ignored_paths` in `.beman-tidy.yaml`. Entries use `.gitignore` pattern syntax.
- Why is a file in my repository not being checked at all?
  - It is probably matched by your `.gitignore`, which beman-tidy honors by default. Set `use_gitignore: false` in `.beman-tidy.yaml` to check ignored files too, or re-include a single path with a `!` entry in `ignored_paths`.
- How do I disable specific rules?
  - Use `disabled_rules` in `.beman-tidy.yaml`. You can specify exact rule names or glob patterns like `readme.*`.
- How do I get more detail?
  - Run with `--verbose` to print per-check diagnostics.
